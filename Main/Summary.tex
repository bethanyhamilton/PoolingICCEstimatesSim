Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) estimates are necessary for several statistical techniques. Researchers need accurate ICC estimates when conducting prospective power analyses for clustered data scenarios. In addition, meta-analysts require reasonable ICC values when adjusting effect size estimates to account for clustered primary study data. The accuracy of both analyses hinge on the value of the ICC estimate that accurately reflects the primary study. 

My aim is to see how well pooled ICC estimates capture a population ICC parameter when using different variance formulas to calculate weights used with robust variance estimation or likelihood-based estimation for the purpose of imputing a pooled ICC for meta-analysis or power analysis in the context of clustered data.
